- [v1](v1/README.md) (pages stored encrypted in a file storage, retrieved and decrypted on the fly by a server handling authorization)
- [v2](v2/README.md) (always-running server generating static sites lazily based on a user's profile)
- [v3](v3/README.md) (v2 but profiles are not in the tokens but in the repository files)
