# Orangutan ðŸ¦§

Lightweight tool allowing private pages on a static site.
It uses predefined profiles to identify users, with no account creation required.

All pages are encrypted, and cannot be read without the decryption key.
This key is not shared to anyone except the back-end server.
[Biscuits](https://www.biscuitsec.org/) are used as authentication tokens,
removing the need for a database keeping track of created tokens.

Design decisions are detailed in [`./design/README.md`](./design/README.md).

> Orangutans are generally solitary animals, and their protective behavior is more focused on their individual needs and survival rather than protecting goods in a social context, as seen in some other primates like chimpanzees. However, orangutans do exhibit protective behaviors in the following ways:
>
> - Territorial Behavior: Orangutans are territorial animals, and adult males, in particular, establish and defend a territory that can encompass a significant area of forest. They mark their territory with vocalizations and by displaying themselves prominently in the trees. This territorial behavior helps ensure that they have access to the necessary resources within their home range, such as fruits, leaves, and insects.
> - Food Protection: While they are not as aggressive in protecting their food as chimpanzees, orangutans may try to safeguard their food from potential theft, including other orangutans or smaller animals. They may use their large size and long arms to intimidate potential food competitors.
> - Nest Building: Orangutans construct nests in the trees for resting and sleeping. They build new nests each day and often choose sturdy branches to ensure safety while they sleep. Although this behavior is not directed at protecting goods, it does serve to protect themselves from predators during the night.
> - Avoiding Conflict: Orangutans are generally peaceful and solitary animals. To minimize conflicts, they often use vocalizations and body language to communicate their presence and intentions to other orangutans in the vicinity. This helps them avoid confrontations, which could be energetically costly.
>
> In summary, while orangutans are not as socially inclined or competitive as some other primates, they do exhibit protective behaviors primarily related to their territoriality, food sources, and personal safety within their solitary lifestyle.
